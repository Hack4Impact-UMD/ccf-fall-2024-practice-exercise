# Directions:

- Make sure to create a folder with your name and create a next.js app within your directory (Do not run npx create-next app in the parent dir)
- Then, implement this figma design: https://www.figma.com/design/8XpsF6BchfruYYzOGndWdn/CCF-Fall-2024-Practice-Exercise?node-id=0-1&node-type=canvas&t=F2SuftTd5m7V1SCz-0 following the instructions on the left of the figma
- It does not have to be pixel perfect, but it should look like the figma and be functional
